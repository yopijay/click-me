# "Click Me"

A simple "Click Me" project using ReactJS for the FrontEnd and Laravel for the BackEnd.
It is an application that presents a single button to the user with the label "Click Me!" and when the user click the button,
a number placed on the center of the screen is incremented.

When the page is loaded for the first time on a new day, the number should reset to 0.
